## MLGRUS

# Description

This repo is the result of working through the book 

*Joel Grus: Data Science from Scratch, O'Reilly (2019)*

and implementing nearly all of its code in Go instead of Python.

The performance gain over Python is enormous and I will say no more.

# Usage

The user may clone the repo and play with the code. The drivers in
*cmd* are examples of how to use the packages in *pkg*.

There are hardly any comments in the code which is regrettable.
